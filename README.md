# How to check out the bug?

First of all run default branch with the following command

`
flutter run --profile
`

In output of this command you will get the url of profile web page. Visit it and get `process memory` page. Then you have to press button in the app and return to web page. Now regulary refresh the page and observe the amount of memory that the app takes.

After that just switch a branch and do same things.
